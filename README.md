OSBib v3.0
A collection of PHP classes to manage bibliographic formatting for OS bibliography software using the OSBib standard.
Taken from and originally developed in WIKINDX (http://wikindx.sourceforge.net).

OSBib is an Open Source bibliographic formatting engine written in PHP that uses XML style files to store formatting
data for in-text or endnote-style (including footnote) citations and bibliographic lists. Released through Bibliophile,
OSBib is designed to work with bibliographic data stored in any format via mapping arrays as defined in the class
STYLEMAP.
